## Analysis Summary

We begin with descriptive statistics, followed by a chi-square test to assess the association between perceived inequality and happiness levels.  
The analysis is further supported by mean comparisons and a multivariate linear regression including control variables.

## Dependencies

The code was written in R (version 4.4.1) and uses the following libraries:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
