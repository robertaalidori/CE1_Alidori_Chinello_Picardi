## Introduction

This research project aims to understand whether individuals' perception of economic inequality has an impact on subjective well-being. A consistent body of research (see Lynch et al., 2004; Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009) has indeed highlighted that economic inequality has an adverse impact on individuals' happiness, general health and social cohesion. The rationale behind this mechanism is that in more unequal societies people tend to increasingly make social status comparisons, which leads to lower self-esteem and life satisfaction, as well as increased stress (Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009). Income inequality is generally measured with indicators such as the Gini index, however, a recent research stream (see Vezzoli et al., 2022) has drawn attention to the much more relevant impact of perception of inequality on well-being, compared to other objective measures of inequality. 

This project tests whether there is a correlation between perception of inequality and subjective well-being among people living in European countries. We hypothesize that the lower the perception of economic inequality, the higher the level of subjective well-being. We assess this hypothesis using the data set provided by the European Social Survey (ESS), a cross-national survey across Europe which provides rigorous data on attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns among individuals living in European countries.



## Data and methods


To measure perception of inequality and subjective well-being we use the ESS Round 9, which has a section with a special focus on justice and fairness. 

From the data-set we selected two variables that provide the most accurate measurements to operationalize our concepts of interest. 

- Variable 1: 'happy' - How happy are you

- Variable 2: 'wltdffr' - Differences in wealth in country, how fair

After the selection, we have created two new versions of the variables. They contain fewer meaningful categories in order to reduce complexity and improve the statistical power of our analysis, and no missing values.

- New variable 1: 'happy_group' - categorical variable with 3 values (Low, Medium, High)

- New variable 2: 'wealth' - categorical variable with 3 values (Fair, Somewhat fair, Very unfair)



### Anlysis


We first conducted a descriptive analysis to explore the distribution of happiness and perceived wealth fairness across the sample. We then conducted a chi-square test to assess whether the two categorical variables were statistically associated. To further investigate if the relations was robust we estimated a linear regression model with other controlling variables.


To measure the percentages of the two variables together we created a cross-table with percentages.
We found out that the majority of individuals fall into the “High” happiness category, regardless of their perception of fairness. However, the proportion of "Low" happiness is highest among those who perceive wealth as "Very Unfair" (3.0%), compared to only 0.2% in the “Fair” group.

We then conducted a chi-square test, confirming that the association between wealth and happy_group is statistically significant (χ² = 879.96, df = 4, p < 0.001), suggesting that perceptions of inequality are meaningfully related to levels of subjective wellbeing.


We also calculated the average happiness level within each category of perceived wealth fairness. The means are as follows:

 - Fair: 8.16
 - Somewhat Fair: 7.74
 - Very Unfair: 7.47

These differences, although modest, show a clear decreasing trend in average happiness as the perception of unfairness increases. This trend is accompanied by 95% confidence intervals that do not overlap substantially, indicating statistically robust group differences.



# ADD-ON analysis:

To assess the relationship between perceived inequality and happiness while controlling for individual-level characteristics, we estimated a linear regression model including gender (gndr), age (agea), and years of education (eduyrs) alongside perceived inequality (wltdffr). 

Results:

wltdffr; +0.052 – Positive and statistically significant

eduyrs; +0.024 – Positive and statistically significant

gndr; +0.003 – Small and not significant

agea; -0.00006 – Negligible

These results suggest that both higher perceived inequality (shouldn't it be higher perceived equality???) and higher education levels are independently associated with higher reported happiness, although the overall explanatory power of the model remains low.

## Results 

In this research project we attempted to test the correlation between perception of inequality and subjective well-being among people living in European countries. To do so, we used data from the European Social Survey  Round 9. Specifically, we focused on the variables measuring the level of happiness and perceived fairness in a country's distribution of wealth.

The results of the cross-tabulation highlight a tendency of people with low levels of happiness to be higher among those with the highest perceptions of inequality while diminishing as the level of perception of equality increases. The opposite is true for people with high level of happiness. The chi-square test confirmed that the association is statistically significant. 

We further investigated the association considering other individual-level characteristics, such as age, gender, and levels of education, through a linear regression model, which confirmed the association between perception of inequality and levels of happiness.

## Discussion 

In conclusion, our analysis showed that there is a negative association between the level of perceived inequality and the level of subjective well-being: people with higher perceptions of inequality tend to display lower levels of happiness compared to those with lower perceptions of inequality. The results confirm our initial hypothesis.
However, our regression analysis, which controlled for other individual-level characteristics, displays an overall low explanatory power, indicating that the phenomenon is complex and should be investigated in much greater depth. As an example, area of residence, income and health, are some factors that could be explored as they may influence both the level of happiness and perceived inequality. 
Although a more comprehensive investigation falls outside the scope of this project, future research might explore those aspects in greater depth, to further elucidate the relationship between perceived inequality and well-being.
